        <h2>Welcome To HeadQuarters.</h2>
        <p>Since HeadQuarters opened its doors in 2011, countless concerts and events have been held, and although we are a place that is constantly evolving, the main element remains the same; our love for music. We are constantly working on new measures to express that love, and now it is the turn of the written media. We call this project HQ music. The name covers a number of initiatives that together form a platform and channel for music dissemination. Here we strive to inspire and convey music across a broad spectrum of genres and expressions ‚Äì no artist is too narrow, unknown or niche.</p>
        <p>HeadQuarters is an oasis in Aarhus, where good music, wonderful experiences and a cozy atmosphere are the first priority.

            Every week there are a multitude of concerts with a primary focus on new, original music. At HeadQuarters we take great pride in presenting a versatile program of high quality to all our guests.
            
            On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, there is an authentic nightclub, which takes you back to the original discotheques, where you can dance all night long.
            HQ, as the place is also called, as a nightclub often has a musical basis in soul, funk and disco, which you can quickly sense when you enter the physical setting that exudes the 60s and 70s.</p>
