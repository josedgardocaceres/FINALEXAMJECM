        <h2>Welcome To Lecoq.</h2>
        <p>In the cozy Latin Quarter, exactly in the street Graven, you will find Lecoq. One of the hip bars in Aarhus that you will become addicted to. Lecoq is divided into two, with a pub in one room and a restaurant in the other. The atmosphere is informal, and the guests show up as they are and in high spirits. There is room for everyone here, and you get along with each other. If you smoke, you can stay at one end of the bar.</p>
        <p>At Lecoq you will find a cozy and informal atmosphere with room for everyone. The atmosphere is often high and there are many people. The inn is divided into several departments, which seem to have a life of their own. You can also take a seat at the bar.</p>
        <p>Tables and chairs are set up outside, just as Hipsterh√∏jen (a small green hill outside the bar) is popular and on sunny days full to bursting point.</p>

        <h2>Must Do‚Äôs</h2>
       <p>üéÆüçª Welcome to Lecoq, where tables are not just for games but also for enjoying company and drinks. üçπ At these tables, you'll find lively rounds of board games and foosball, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The competition around the foosball table at the end of the bar is legendary, making it a hotspot for friendly (or not-so-friendly) matches.</p>
       <p>üç∫ Most patrons come for the cold beers, and Lecoq doesn't disappoint with a selection of beers on tap and a variety of bottled options. Whether you're a beer enthusiast or just looking to unwind, there's a brew for everyone.</p>
       <p>ü•Ç What sets Lecoq apart is its recognition as the go-to spot for Chartreuse, the monk liqueur from the French Alps. üèîÔ∏è With an alcohol percentage of 55, it's a beverage that sparks conversations and is a unique experience, especially for first-timers. Lecoq proudly holds the title of selling the most Chartreuse in Denmark, and perhaps, in the whole world. If you're feeling adventurous or want a different shot or cocktail, the bar has you covered.
        <p>So, gather your friends, pick your game, and enjoy the spirited ambiance of Lecoq! üïπÔ∏èüç∫</p>
