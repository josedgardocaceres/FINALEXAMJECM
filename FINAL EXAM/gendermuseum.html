        <h2>Welcome To The Gender Museum.</h2>
        <p>GENDER ‚Äì Gender Museum Denmark is located in Aarhus. GENDER focuses on gender culture and debates gender issues, equality, the body and sexuality. The museum's vision is to create curiosity, dialogue, reflection and knowledge about the importance of gender; historical, current and in the future. Therefore, K√òN deals with the cultural history of the sexes in a broader perspective and involves everyone across genders.</p>
        <p>In May 2016, the Danish Palaces and Culture Agency recognized that K√òN ‚Äì Gender Museum Denmark (then the Women's Museum in Denmark) had new responsibilities. The museum was founded in 1982, when women's culture and history were greatly under-examined. In the past decades, the museum has collected significant documentation of women's everyday life as well as women's active participation in social development. Much has happened since then in the relationship between the two sexes. Men's roles and function in society have also changed significantly. The cultural heritage rests in places on old divisions between genders and roles, while the present expects freer expression of all genders. Therefore, the museum K√òN will in future deal more broadly with the cultural history of the sexes and involve everyone across genders.</p>
