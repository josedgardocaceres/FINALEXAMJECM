It is open Thursday to Sunday from 15 or 16.</p>
       <P>During the summer period, things are going well in the tent at Bar Hygs. You sit at long tables and get to know each other. The conversation goes across the tables and there is loud singing. Occasionally there are also people on the dance floor. The floor is tiled, and string lights are suspended. The atmosphere is good and down to earth. There is room for everyone here. At the weekend and in the evenings, there is a party atmosphere. If the weather is good, the live music and the party occasionally move outside. The service is welcoming and in a good mood.</P>
