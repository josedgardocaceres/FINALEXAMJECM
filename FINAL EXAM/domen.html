        <h2>Welcome To Domen.</h2>
        <p>Domen is a landmark on Aarhus Harbor and a symbol of, among other things, innovation, citizenship and green transformation in Aarhus Municipality.

            Domen is a city life house with a view to the sky and sea. It is located at the far end of Pier 2 in the temporary city park. In 2018, Innovation and Citizenship took over the Dome, on behalf of Aarhus Municipality, in order to provide an informal, inspiring and sustainable meeting place for both citizens, associations and businesses.
            
            All initiatives and activities held in Domen support citizenship, sustainability and community. The dome's 450 square meters, spread over two levels, provides space for both a climate cafÃ© and bar, office spaces, a stage and a conference hall, which can accommodate around 150 people, and a lot of green plants that thrive in the fantastic light, which together create a whole special atmosphere.</p>
